### UI/Handling

FOSS Browser uses the latest [Material You](https://m3.material.io/) design libraries and guidelines. Following system day/night mode and a wallpaper based theme are  just two features of this new library. The UI is optimized for one-hand-use. All elements to controll the app are orientaded at the bottom of the screen.

----
### Privacy

FOSS Browser uses profiles to protect your privacy (trusted/standard/protected). For each profile you can enable or disable: AdBlock, JavaScript, cookies, fingerprint protection and much more. Profiles can also be saved for domains (p.a. "github.com" â‡’ Trusted website). This saved domains always overwrite the current profile. So, for example, "github.com" will always open with the trusted profile, even if you are browsing in the protected mode.

More privacy features:

- Build in AdBlock, which updates automatically. You can decide which content to block.
- Third-part-cookies can not e enabled.
- Enable or disable Android-autofill.
- Delete browser data (on app exit).
- Choose between different search engines (or set a custom one).
- FOSS Browser itself doesn't collect any data: [Privacy](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/PRIVACY.md)
