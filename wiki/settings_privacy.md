## Privacy settings

![Settings (Main screen)](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/screenshots/settings_privacy.png)

From here, you can open settings for: [Edit profiles](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/settings_profile_edit.md) | [Profile list](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/settings_profile_list.md)

### 1: Form data

Enable this to save filled out form data on devices running Android Nougat or below. Saving form data is no longer possible since Android Oreo. Instead, you can use Androids autofill service. You need a password manager which supports autofill service. You can find several on [F-Droid](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=password&lang=en).

### 2: Profile on app start

FOSS Browser has three profiles: trusted, standard and protected. Here, you can decide which profile to load on every app start. For more information about profile settings, look here ⇒ [Edit profiles](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/settings_profile_edit.md).

----

### 3: Edit profiles

Here you can edit the settings of the three profiles. ⇒ [Edit profiles](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/settings_profile_edit.md).

----

### 4: Profile lists

Profiles can be saved for domains ("github.com" ⇒ Trusted website). This saved domains always overwrite the current profile. So, for example, "github.com" will always open with the trusted profile, even if you are browsing in the protected mode. ⇒ [Profile list](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/settings_profile_list.md)

----

### 5: Blocked content

FOSS Browser comes with a build in AdBlock. AdBlock's hosts are taken from [Steven Black - AbBlock hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts). These hosts are updated regularly. In the settings, you can see the date of the last update of the master host file. Here you can decide, which content to block:

- Unified hosts = (adware + malware)
- fake news
- gambling
- porn
- social: this can also break content from Facebook and other social media platforms

### Custom JavaScript code

This is an advanced feature. If you don't know what it means, it should better be empty and disabled.
