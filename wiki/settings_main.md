## Settings (Main screen)

This is the settings main screen. Here you can change the following:

#### Favorite

Here you can enter the url of your startsite. The url entered here will be loaded on app start. If you leave this empty, FOSS Browser opens a blank site on start.

#### Search engine

Decide between several search engines. If the prefered search engine isn't supported you can also set a custom one in the advanced settings.
