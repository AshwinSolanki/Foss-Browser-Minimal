### 1: Favorite

Here you can enter the url of your startsite. The url entered here will be loaded on app start. If you leave this empty, FOSS Browser opens a blank site on start.

----

### 2: Search engine

Decide between several search engines. If the prefered search engine isn't supported, you can also set a custom one in the advanced settings.

### 3: Advanced

__Custom search engine:__ If your prefered search engine is not listed in the settings (2), you can enter here a custom one. If you make a search with your browser the url looks like:

`http://blahblah.com?search=%s`

where your browser replaces the %s with the content of the search box. You can nearly use all search fields (on nearly any website) to get such a url. These urls can be set as a custom search engine.

__Custom user agent:__ Custom UserAgent allows to change your browser's user-agent. This can for example be used to load websites in desktop view by default. Here you can find a list with actual examples: [Latest user agents for Web Browsers & Operating Systems](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/the-latest-user-agent/).
