## Edit profiles

![Settings (Main screen)](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/screenshots/settings_profile_edit.png)

Here you can edit the three profiles trusted, standard and protected. The settings are organized in three cotegories: Data usage, Privacy, Security.

----

### 1: Data usage

- _Images:_ You can disable the loading of images to save data usage.<br>
- _AdBlock:_ Blocking unwanted ads also saves data traffic and protects your privacy. In the [Privacy settings](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/settings_privacy.md) you can decide which content to block.<br>
- _Request 'Savedata':_ If you enable this FOSS Browser sends a request to each website. By identifying this header, a web page can (not must) customize and deliver an optimized user experience to cost- and performance-constrained users. When this feature is enabled FOSS Browser may request lower resolution images, defer loading of some resources, or route requests through a service that applies other content-specific optimizations such as image and text resource compression.<br>
