## Edit profiles

![Settings (Main screen)](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/screenshots/settings_profile_edit.png)

Here you can edit the three profiles trusted, standard and protected. The settings are organized in three categories: Data usage, Privacy, Security.

----

### 1: Data usage

- __Images:__ You can disable the loading of images to save data usage.
- __AdBlock:__ Blocking unwanted ads also saves data traffic and protects your privacy. In the [Privacy settings](https://github.com/scoute-dich/browser/blob/master/wiki/settings_privacy.md) you can decide which content to block.
- __Request 'Savedata':__ If you enable this FOSS Browser sends a request to each website. By identifying this header, a web page can (not must) customize and deliver an optimized user experience to cost- and performance-constrained users. When this feature is enabled, FOSS Browser may request lower resolution images, defer loading of some resources, or route requests through a service that applies other content-specific optimizations such as image and text resource compression.

### 2: Privacy

- __Location:__ If you disable this, websites can not get your precise location. Some services (like navigation, find the nearest shop, ...) may not work then. Disabling this does not hide the origin of your IP-number. So, websites can get the location of your IP-number.
- __Allow camera usage:__ This allows FOSS Browser to use the device camera. You need this for WebRTC support. Otherwise, you can not use camera in online conferences.
- __Allow microphone usage:__ This allows FOSS Browser to use the device microphone. You require this for WebRTC support. Otherwise, you can not use microphone during online meetings.
- __History:__ Whether save browsing history or not.
- __Fingerprint protection:__ Browser fingerprinting happens when websites use special scripts to collect enough information about you - such as your browser, timezone, default language, and more - that they can uniquely identify you out of the sea of other internet users. 
- __Cookies:__ Cookies are small blocks of data created by a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user’s web browser. Cookies serve useful and sometimes essential functions on the web. They enable web servers to store stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) on the user’s device or to track the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to save for subsequent use information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers. Tracking cookies, and especially third-party tracking cookies (which are disabled in FOSS Browser), are commonly used as ways to get records of individuals' browsing histories - a potential privacy concern. Disabling cookies can protect your privacy.
- __DOM Storage:__ DOM storage (Document Object Model storage), provides websites possibilities to store data on the users' device. They work similar to cookies, but with a greatly enhanced capacity. They can store more data and the data can be longer saved.

----

### 3: Security

- __JavaScript:__ JavaScript is a core technology for the worldwide web. Most websites will not work properly, if you disable JavaScript. JavaScript is used to display images, videos, menus and so on. But of course, JavaScript can also be used to perform malware code.
- __Popups:__ Disabling this prevents websites from opening new popup windows.
